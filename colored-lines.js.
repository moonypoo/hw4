Assignment: Modify the code above to draw each line in a different color. 
Consider using HSB color mode and re-using the x variable as the hue. Save in your repo as colored-lines.js.\



function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  colorMode(HSB)
}

function draw() {
  background(255);

  for (var x = 10; x < width-10; x = x + 10) {
    line(x, height/2, mouseX, mouseY);
    stroke (50,50,50)
  }
  
    for (var x = 10; x < width-10; x = x + 20) {
    line(x, height/2, mouseX, mouseY);
    stroke (125,150,50)
  }
  
}
