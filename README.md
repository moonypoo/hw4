  for (var x = 10; x < width-10; x = x + 10) {
  the first one sets the value of X to 10 pixels
  the second 10 is when the condition is to repeat before it hits 400 pixels
  the last 10 - sets the next increment to repeat 10 pixels after the fact.

Next, make the following changes:

Assignment: Increase the number of concentric circles from 5 to 10. Save in your repo as 10-circles.js.
Assignment: Modify the code to draw squares instead of circles, of the same width and height. Save in your repo as square-circles.js
Optional Challenge: Modify the code to draw a different shape altogether. Maybe use a triangle, or make a custom shape using beginShape and vertex! (Look these up in the p5.js reference) Save in your repo as other-circles.js.
